# Web IFC .NET

A [C++/CLI wrapper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B/CLI) around the 
[C++ code](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_web-ifc/tree/main/src/cpp) 
powering the [Web IFC library](https://github.com/ThatOpen/engine_web-ifc)
originally written by [Tom van Diggelen](https://github.com/tomvandig) 
and being developed by [That Open Company](https://github.com/ThatOpen).

## What is C++/CLI

C++/CLI is a variant of C++ that makes it easier to write interoperability code 
that communicates between C# and C++. This is not unlike how the C++ code is 
compiled using WASM to be usable from JavaScript.  

# Project Goals 

The first goal of this project is to set-up an NUnit test suite to make it easier 
to debug, profile, refactor, and optimize.
